# mst-kruskal
An exploration of Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.


 Purpose
 
    This project explores Kruskal's algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees and greedy strategies in general.
 
 Input
    
    A list of vertices and edges, which is then converted to a graph.
    
 Output
    
    A minimum spanning tree created from the graph.
